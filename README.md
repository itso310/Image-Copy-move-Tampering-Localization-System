# BachelorGraduationProject
my Bachelor Graduation Project

This is a python-based program which used a model designed in https://github.com/isi-vista/BusterNet.
The software can achieve image cropping, pasting and saving. 
Moreover, simple tampered image localization and batch tampered images localization can also be completed by this software.
总之是一个python写的软件，用pyqt5做的UI，可以打开文件，检测文件（是否有复制粘帖的篡改）。可以批处理（直接处理一个文件夹的图片），也可以用户自己复制粘帖篡改然后再检测。
毕设项目。



Here are some decriptions:

The invention of image editing software leads to the proliferation of tampered images and makes images less credible. 
Copy-move tampering is a common type of forgery in digital image tampering. 
So, the digital image copy-move tampering and localization system will help people, especially those with occupational needs, distinguish and analyze the forged images. 
Therefore, using the latest copy-move tampering detection algorithm BusterNet and PyQt5 as the system framework, this paper designs a digital image copy-move tampering and localization system based on Python language, OpenCV and PIL digital image processing library. 
Through the model and software test, the results show that the digital image copy-move tampering and localization system has certain accuracy, so it has certain practicability.
